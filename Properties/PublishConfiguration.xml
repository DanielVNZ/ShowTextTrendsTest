	<LongDescription>
This is a new version of Show Text Trends, it introduces a movable/resizable UI that can be hidden.

Oh! and it now shows your ** monthly profit! **


## How to use:

* When you first load the game it will be open by default in the top left corner. Click and hold to drag it where you'd prefer.
* Resize the window by dragging the bottom right corner.
* Hold your left mouse button for 2.5 seconds to reset the window to default location/size.
* The position of the container will save when you restart and load your game.
* If you do want to close it, you can reopen it with the button in the bottom left corner of your screen.

## Why not just update the original mod?

This mod changes a lot, and I know people still love to use the existing one. So for that reason, the new UI will be its own mod.

## Credits:

Thank you so much to StarQ, you have been an absolute legend with the code and the new name of the mod!
