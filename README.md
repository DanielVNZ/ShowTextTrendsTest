This is a new version of Show Text Trends, it introduces a movable/resizable UI that can be hidden.

Oh! and it now shows your monthly profit!

## How to use:
* When you first load the game it will be open by default in the top left corner. Click and hold to drag it where you'd prefer.
* Resize the window by dragging the bottom right corner.
* The position of the container will save when you restart and load your game.


**If you do want to close it, you can reopen it with the button in the bottom left corner of your screen, Why not just update the original mod?**

This mod changes a lot, and I know people still love to use the existing one. So for that reason, the new UI will be its own mod.
